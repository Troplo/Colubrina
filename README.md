You can try a public instance of Colourbrina at [Colourbrina.troplo.com](https://Colourbrina.troplo.com/).

This is currently beta software, and may not work as expected. Please file an issue if you encounter any.

Colourbrina is a simple self-hostable chatting platform written in Vue, and Vuetify for the frontend, and Node.js, Sequelize and Socket.io for the backend.

## Backend setup
First, configure a database and user (MariaDB strongly recommended) for Colourbrina.<br>
Please navigate to the `backend` folder and run `yarn`.<br>

Then navigate to the `cli` folder, and run the following commands:

```
yarn
```
to install dependencies, and then
```
node .
```
which should result in an interactive CLI prompt looking like the following:
```
